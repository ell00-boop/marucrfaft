            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Mojang Studios. Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming language, the first public test build was released on 17 May 2009. The game would continue to be developed over the span of two years, until its full release on 18 November 2011. Afterwards, Persson left Mojang and gave Jens "Jeb" Bergensten control over the game's development. In the years since its release, it has been ported to several platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and various video game consoles, primarily by 4J Studios. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Minecraft has become the best-selling video game of all-time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>In Minecraft, players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain made up of voxels. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players. The game has two main modes; one being survival mode, where players must acquire resources to survive, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly. Several other game modes exist besides the two main ones, such as one that allows players to spectate others and one that plays identically to survival mode, but features permadeath. The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Critical Acclaim</h2>
            <p>Minecraft has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time; social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minicraft, Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Earth, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Legends. In addition, a live-action film based on the game is scheduled for a theatrical release in April 2025.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox video game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. The game also features an optional achievement system. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, commonly referred to as "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">World Generation</h2>
            <p>The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player). While there are limits on the world's verticality, Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane, up to 30 million blocks from the world's center. The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller 16 by 16 sections called "chunks" that are created or loaded only when players are nearby. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields; the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Mobs and Skins</h2>
            <p>New players are given a randomly selected default character skin out of 9 possibilities, including Steve or Alex, but are able to create and upload their own skins. Players encounter various mobs (short for mobile entities), such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures. Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, witches, creepers, skeletons, endermen, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves. Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear. Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks). There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans, respectively.</p>

    <p>
        Markus "Notch" Persson, the creator of Minecraft, was a game developer at King until March 2009. During his time at King, he worked on browser games and learned various programming languages. In his spare time, he prototyped his own games, often inspired by other games and shared his work on the TIGSource forums for independent developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of his personal projects was "RubyDung," a base-building game inspired by Dwarf Fortress but with a three-dimensional isometric view. He had also developed a 3D texture mapper for a zombie game prototype. Inspired by Infiniminer, a block-based open-ended mining game released in April 2009, Persson adapted its visual style and block-building mechanics for his own game, which he named Minecraft.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to purchase Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property. This deal, suggested by Persson on Twitter, was completed on 6 November 2014. The acquisition led to Persson becoming one of Forbes' "World's Billionaires".
    </p>
    <p>
        Since its first full release, Minecraft has received numerous updates. The most recent major update, "Tricky Trials," was released in June 2024, adding new creatures, structures, and items. The original version was renamed to Minecraft: Java Edition on 18 September 2017. The Bedrock Edition, which has also been regularly updated, received a Bedrock Edition-exclusive beta called Minecraft RTX on 16 April 2020, featuring physically based rendering, real-time path tracing, and DLSS. The public release was on 8 December 2020.
