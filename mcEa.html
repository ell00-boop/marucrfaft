                <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Minecraft Earth</strong> was an augmented reality (AR) game developed by Mojang Studios. Released in 2019, it allowed players to build, explore, and interact with the Minecraft world in the real world using AR technology. Players could collaborate with others, place blocks, and discover resources by interacting with the environment around them.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Gameplay</h2>
                <p>Minecraft Earth combined elements of augmented reality with the familiar gameplay of Minecraft, letting players create structures and gather resources by walking around in the real world. The game used your phone’s camera and GPS to place Minecraft elements in your surroundings, allowing for an immersive experience.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
                <p>The game offered various innovative features such as life-sized builds, collaborative gameplay, and resource gathering using augmented reality. Players could also participate in adventures, which were short missions that involved combat and exploration, all while interacting with the physical world.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Critical Acclaim</h2>
                <p>Upon release, Minecraft Earth received praise for its innovative use of augmented reality technology. It allowed Minecraft fans to engage with the game in a new way, blending the virtual world with the real world. However, the game was later discontinued in June 2021 due to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and limitations in AR technology adoption.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Game World</h2>
                <p>In Minecraft Earth, the real world became the game world. Players could see their Minecraft creations through the lens of their smartphones and interact with them in a way that felt tangible. This mix of the physical and virtual provided a unique experience for Minecraft fans, although it required a modern smartphone with AR capabilities.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Development of Minecraft Earth</h2>
                <p>Minecraft Earth was developed by Mojang Studios as part of its efforts to expand the Minecraft universe beyond the traditional gaming platforms. The development team worked to integrate augmented reality into the familiar Minecraft mechanics, creating a new experience that allowed players to explore and build in the real world.</p>
